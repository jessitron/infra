# LOOK: this is weird

These are the files I last applied. But the state is (sadly local) in a different directory,
~/code/martinjt/demo-eks-alb

Sorry, future Jess!!!

next time you recreate this cluster, do it from here, and get the state in the right place!

# part 2, less weird

June 2023

oh no, future Jess could have used that information but missed it.

But now the cluster has been created here with the state in s3, whew. Bucket jessitron-infra

# Minimal demo: AWS EKS with ALB

- Uses the default backend configuration
- AWS authentication requires additional configuration, such as selecting a CLI profile. For more, see https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration.
- This repository can build a minimal EKS cluster with an ALB, and omits as much detail as possible. **It does not demonstrate security, best practice, nor least privilege -- be mindful of your observability, public access, and IAM policies!**
- Requires Terraform 1.3 or above.
- Estimated cost to run (in `eu-west-1`): 0.2628 $/hr = 6.3 $/day = 189 $/month
  - VPC NAT Gateways (2x): 2\*0.048 $/hr = 0.096 $/hr
  - EKS Cluster: $0.10 /hr
  - EKS Node Group (2x `t3.small`): 2\*0.0208 $/hr
  - Application Load Balancer: 0.0252 $/hr
- To deploy it, run `terraform init` followed by `terraform apply`. It takes ~15 minutes to complete.
- Upon completion, the cluster will run [httpbin](https://github.com/postmanlabs/httpbin) fronted by an ALB. The ALB hostname is given by the `httpbin_ingress_host` output value.
- You might see `Warning: "default_secret_name" is no longer applicable for Kubernetes v1.24.0 and above`. Although it doesn't apply to this demo, this warning can't be suppressed (see [this issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-kubernetes/issues/1990)).
- To tear it down, run `terraform destroy`.
